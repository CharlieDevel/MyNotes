# Reason
We need to extract data from files(which can be located in file systems or github repositories), and specific files according to the selected language to analyze to be able to define how are we going to **exactly extract that language to more abstract parts**(as in treating a function in javascript or C# equal),  
> Thus, we must know how to get the files -> the contents of the files ->how to interpret the content of those files -> and process their contents for later analysis

# Concerns
- File system access
- Read specific files(.cs, .java, .js)
- Github repository acccess
